# CSharpAesFileCrypter
A GUI for encrypting files with AES-256 encryption. The program uses streams so it's very efficiant and works on big files with low memory footprint

## Fetures
- Generate secure AES-256 keys and IVs
- Encrypt & decrypt files using streams
- Lightweight (compared to a website)
