# CSharpAesFileCrypter
A GUI for encrypting files with AES-256 encryption. The program uses streams so it's very efficiant and works on big files with low memory footprint

## Fetures
- Generate secure AES-256 keys and IVs
- Encrypt & decrypt files using streams
- Lightweight (compared to a website)

## Image
[image of program](./image.png)

## Todo
- Add better image of the program to the README, since the current one is on linux and looks a bit odd.
- Update release, it's 10 commits behind

## Other
This is currently the most starred project on my profile, for some reason. So if you like it please look at my other projects, for example [mandelbrot](https://github.com/Dko1905/mandelbrot), and thanks for all the stars.
